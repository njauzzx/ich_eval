Large language modeling has permeated various fields of society and considerably impacted the humanities and social sciences. The emergence of domain-specific large language models (LLMs) has opened new avenues for research in these fields. For instance, in the area of intangible cultural heritage (ICH), domain-specific LLMs provide a digital approach for preserving and transmitting ICH-related knowledge. A comprehensive model evaluation benchmark is essential to develop an effective ICH-oriented LLM. This study focuses on the ICH domain, utilizing relevant data sourced from the China ICH network. Based on this data, an evaluation system centered on domain knowledge was constructed. A collection of high-performing, open-source LLMs were selected to assess their performance in the ICH domain. The proposed evaluation system serves as a reference for developing specialized LLMs for ICH and applying language modeling technology in the field of ICH.
